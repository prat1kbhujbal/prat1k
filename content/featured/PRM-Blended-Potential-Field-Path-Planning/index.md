To overcome limitations of PRM like narrow pathways and environments with dynamic obstacles, PRM with potential fields can be implemented. Potential field can be generated for the workspace, will help determine the complexity of workspace and adequate number of sampling points required, and then ensure high density of sampling points around the obstacles by implementing a regional sampling strategy.
